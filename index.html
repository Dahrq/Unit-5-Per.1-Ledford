    <h1>Headers</h1>
        <p>Headers are used to create titles and section titles.  There are 6 different sizes pre-formatted for HTML.</p>
    <h1>h1-Computer Science</h1>
    <h2>h2-Computer Science</h2>
    <h3>h3-Computer Science</h3>
    <h4>h4-Computer Science</h4>
    <h5>h5-Computer Science</h5>
    <h6>h6-Computer Science</h6>

    <h1>Text Formatting</h1>
    <p>There are three main types of text formatting.  Those are <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, and <u>underline</u>.</p>

    <h2>Inline vs. Block Elements</h2>
        <p>A <b>block element</b> moves the content to a new line. The paragraph and header elements are block elements.
        An <b>inline element</b> does not display its content on a new line.  It keeps the content on the same line as
        the previous content. Bold, italics and underline are all inline elements.</p>

    <h3><u>Block Elements Examples</u></h3>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p><p>This is a paragraph on the same line in the code as the precious paragraph, but it still
        moves to the next line</p>

    <h3><u>Inline Elements Examples</u></h3>
        <p>This is a paragraph with <b>emphasized text</b>.  Notice how the text does not move to a new line</p>

    <h2>Vertical Text Spacing</h2>
    <p>There are two elements that help with vertical spacing between block elements.  A <b>line break</b> element adds
    an empty line and moves the content down to a new line.  It's similar to the <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key in a Google/Word doc</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Above this paragraph is a line break</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph is a horizontal rule.</p>
