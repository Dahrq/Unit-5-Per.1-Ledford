        <p>Headers are used to create titles and section titles.  There are 6 different sizes pre-formatted for HTML.</p>

    <h1>Text Formatting</h1>
    <p>There are three main types of text formatting.  Those are <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, and <u>underline</u>.</p>

    <h2>Inline vs. Block Elements</h2>
        <p>A <b>block element</b> moves the content to a new line. The paragraph and header elements are block elements.
        An <b>inline element</b> does not display its content on a new line.  It keeps the content on the same line as
        the previous content. Bold, italics and underline are all inline elements.</p>

    <h3><u>Block Elements Examples</u></h3>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p><p>This is a paragraph on the same line in the code as the precious paragraph, but it still
        moves to the next line</p>

    <h3><u>Inline Elements Examples</u></h3>
        <p>This is a paragraph with <b>emphasized text</b>.  Notice how the text does not move to a new line</p>

    <h2>Vertical Text Spacing</h2>
    <p>There are two elements that help with vertical spacing between block elements.  A <b>line break</b> element adds
    an empty line and moves the content down to a new line.  It's similar to the <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key in a Google/Word doc</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Above this paragraph is a line break</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph is a horizontal rule.</p>

    <h1 style="color: #f05454">Attributes</h1>
    <p><b>Attributes</b> are properties which can change an HTML element. Attributes are written in the opening tag of
    ANY HTML element.  The most common attributes are <i>src</i>, <i>href</i>, <i>class</i>, <i>id</i>, and <i>style</i>.
    </p>

    <h2>Inline CSS Styles</h2>
    <p>The <i>style</i> attribute allows you to add CSS style to any HTML element.</p>

    <p style="color: slategrey" > This paragraph has inline CSS style which changes the font color to indigo.</p>

    <p style="background-color: blueviolet">This paragraph has inline CSS style which changes the background color to
        coral.
    </p>

    <p style="color: blueviolet; background-color: slategrey">This paragraph has inline CSS style which changes the
        background color <b>AND</b> the font color.</p>

    <p style="font-family: 'Jokerman'">This paragraph has a different font type.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 42px">This paragraph has a different font size.</p>

    <p style="background-color: #008891; color: #e7e7de; font-family: 'Vladimir Script'; font-size: 36px">This paragraph
    has all four of the previous inline styles.</p>

    <h1 style="color: #f05454">Images</h1>
    <p>An <b>image element</b> is an <i>inline</i> element which inserts pictures into the document. An image element
        is self-closing, which means it does not have a closing tag. It has one major attribute, src, which is a
        filepath that points to the images/ location. Those filepaths can either be <b>absolute</b> or
        <b>relative</b>.</p>

        <h2>Simple Image Example</h2>
        <img src="https://hhltmaine.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Hawk-Coopers-JBe.jpg">

        <h2>Image Attributes</h2>
        <p>There are 4 attributes commonly used for images. <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> are used to resize the images.
        <i>alt</i> allows the use of text description of images for accessibility and broken images. <i>title</i> allows
            a hover-over text to appear.</p>

        <h3>Width and Height</h3>
        <p>The width and height can be measured in many different ways, but the more common ones are pixels and
            percentages. Using pixels, you set the specific, precise size based on pixels.  Using percentages, you set
            the dimensions based on a percentage of the entire page.  In either case, setting the width alone respects
            aspect ratio, while setting both does not.</p>

        using percentages" width="50%">

        <h3>Alt Attribute</h3>
        <p>Every picture should at LEAST have the alt attribute.  The alt attribute helps with screen readers for
        visually impaired and in the cases that the image is broken.</p>
